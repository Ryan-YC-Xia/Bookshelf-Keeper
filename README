ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:

Please grade the assignment towards the bonus.

One thing worth mentioning is that I used a stack to represent the 
temporary pile of books when performing putting and picking operations
on the bookshelf in the BookshelfKeeper class. I made this choice because
I think it's intuitive to use a stack to represent a "stack" of books,
and the operations on stack perfectly suits the need in this case.
I think this is a good chance to practice using a stack in Java.
